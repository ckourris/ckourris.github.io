<b> Hallo</b>!
I am a PhD research student at in the group of <a href = "https://tu-dresden.de/mn/physik/itp/tfp">Prof. Matthias Vojta</a>.
        I was previously a summer research student and later master's student at <a href = "https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/group/condensed-matter-theory">
          Oxford</a>. I spend most of my time thinking about strongly correlated quantum many body systems. 
          <br>This is a site for my work, and other things I often think about.
