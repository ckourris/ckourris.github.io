<br/>
Random Forests are supervised ensemble-learning models used for classification and regression. Ensemble learning models aggregate multiple machine learning models, allowing for overall better performance. The logic behind this is that each of the models used is weak when employed on its own, but strong when put together in an ensemble. In the case of Random Forests...

<br/>
Recently, we published a research paper showing how it is possible to detect fraudulent credit card transactions with a high level of accuracy and a low number of false positives. By using ensembles of cost-sensitive decision trees, we can save up to 73 percent of losses stemming from fraud. Here’s how.<a href='http://blog.easysol.net/cost-sensitive-decision-trees/' target="_blank">[Read more]</a>

<br/>
In our new series, Machine Learning Algorithms Explained, our goal is to give you a good sense of how the algorithms behind machine learning work, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of different methods. Each post in this series will briefly explain a different algorithm.

<br/>
Online, or real-time, transactional fraud detection systems have recently created quite the buzz in the info security industry. They are an appealing concept: Because we know that fraud patterns change over time, the ability to use machine-learning algorithms to automatically learn new patterns instantly allows us to have a stronger defense system.

<br/>
Machine learning models are often dismissed on the grounds of lack of interpretability. There is a popular story about modern algorithms that goes as follows: Simple linear statistical models such as logistic regression yield to interpretable models. On the other hand, advanced models such as random forest or deep neural networks are black boxes, meaning it is nearly impossible to understand how a model is making a prediction...
