I am a PhD student at TU Dresden, working directly under Prof. Matthias Vojta. My main research interests are strongly correlated quantum systems, frustrated magnetism, and the application of geometry and topology in solid state physics. 

I completed my master's degree at the University of Oxford, where I specialised in condensed matter theory. I wrote a dissertation under Prof. Bruno Bertini on quantum quenches of interacting systems. Before that, I spent a summer working with Dr. Felix Flicker at the Rudolf Peierls Institute of Theoretical Physics, doing some numerical work on dipolar classical spin ice. I obtained my bachelor's in Mathematical Physics from the University of Edinburgh. In my second year, I spent the summer at the Royal Observatory of Edinburgh, on a numerical project.

### More Information

Besides physics, I happily have other things occupying my mind, which I often approach with academic interests. These include history, philosophy, and their connections to all other fields (even in [physics!](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physics-structuralism/)). I am also a chess player.
